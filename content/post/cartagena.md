title: "CARTAGENA COLOMBIA DAY TRIPS"
---

ICartagena, Colombia was the first city of our three month backpacking trip after we quit our jobs. It will always hold a special place in our hearts. 

Our travels in and around Cartagena were amazing, and we have truly fallen in love with this city of brightly colored buildings, delicious food, and amazingly kind people who have so much pride for their home.

Here is a little run down of what we did in Cartagena:

- days of Spanish lessons at Nueva Lengua
- castle explored (Castillo San Felipe)
- different tropical juices drank (My favorite? Lulo con leche. Un-freakin-believable)
- mud volcano bathed (Volcan Totumo)
- beaches visited (Rosario Island Day Trip)
- dress bought at a supermarket
- “routine” pat downs by the police
- massage on the beach
- days of sunburns
- hostels slept 

Many cervesas drank, countless pictures taken, muchos Spanish phrases learned, far more arepas than a human should eat were consumed, lots of travelers met, and one unforgettable city explored.
If you are ever in Cartagena, you have to explore the old walled city and get lost among the colorful doors and beautiful plazas. Buy fresh fruit from a cart vendor and get a shot of the local coffee from a man carrying thermoses. 

At night time, stroll from plaza to plaza and watch dancers perform routines for people dining out on a patio.
