title: "GUIDE TO SALENTO: A TOWN WITH CULTURE, COFFEE AND CHARM"
---
Depending on who you talk to, a trip to Salento, Colombia can bring up different reactions.

After telling one friend I was headed to Colombia, he gave me a hug and told me how excited he was for me to meet the friendliest people in the world and experience the vibrant culture of his home country.

But the other reactions I got weren’t so rosy. People I barely knew warned me to “be careful of drug lords”. And even today when I list Colombia as one of my favorite countries I’ve ever traveled, people always seems to bring up the “C” word. Cocaine.

Yes, there’s no denying that Colombia’s history includes infamous drug cartels and violence. But that’s just one chapter. It’s a shame that this chapter is still so closely tied to a country that should be known for so much more – hammocks strung between palms on perfect beaches, the best coffee in the world, lush jungle-covered mountains, progressive cities, people who exude warmth and a culture so colorful and vibrant words can’t paint a picture.

It was this Colombia that I fell in love with. It is this Colombia that I want to tell you about. And I’ve got 3 new “C” words I think much better describe this country…
