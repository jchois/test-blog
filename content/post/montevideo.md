**The Free Walking Tour**

We always try to do free walking tours when they’re available, so that we can educate ourselves about new places that we know little about, and luckily the one in Montevideo came highly recommended. We met up with our fast talking, mate swilling guide Valentín and began the 3 hour tour with 20 other travellers.
