## CLIMB EL PEÑOL FOR A GREAT VIEW

The whole area was flooded in the 1970s to make way for a huge hydro-electric dam. This resulted in a village or two being relocated and tourism having a much bigger role to play in the economy given that all the fields were, well, submerged. 

A probably unintended benefit of this project however was the creation of a pretty great view. The signs in town call it 'the best view in the world' (it's not) but it's definitely worth seeing for yourself. 

And all you have to do is climb a lot of steep stairs (740 to be precise) up the side of a bloody big rock. You will be knackered (Andrew is not faking it in the picture!)

How to get there | We've read that some people took a tour here - don't! It's easy to do on your own from the town or from Medellin.

If you're staying in the centre of town, the quickest option to reach El Peñol is to get a tuk-tuk or one of the collectivo jeeps to take you to the entrance. 

You can however do what we did and walk there on your own! From Guatapé, take the road out of town on the left (back towards Medellin). Keep to this road for around 45 minutes and you'll start to see a number of hotels etc and the Peñol on your left hand side. At the garage, take the road on the left up the hill and you'll eventually reach the entrance. If you don't fancy walking all the way back, a tuk-tuk will cost $8000.
