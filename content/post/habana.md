title: "Habana Vieja and the Little Farter"
---

Ever since I first opened James Bond’s guide to the West Indies at age twelve, I wanted to see one for myself—a Pedorrera: Cuba’s mysterious and dazzling Little Farter.  I’ve just arrived in Havana, and rented an apartment in Havana’s historic, bustling quarter, Habana Vieja.

The airport taxi driver looks at me, says, “I haven’t seen a lot of Americans.”

“Well,” I respond.  “The airplane was empty.”  I show him the eerie photos I had taken of the interior of the flight from Atlanta to Havana.  “None of these people are U.S. citizens,” I tell him. “Just me,” I say, pointing to the bald heads several rows ahead of me, “Canadians!”  

I point to some heads several rows ahead of them.  “These people here spoke Spanish, but not English. I think they are Cubans!”

“So, how did you get here as a U.S. citizen?  It is very difficult, no?” he asks, weaving around a mess of old 1950’s Chevrolet Bel Airs, Moskvitch 2141’s from the 1980’s and Polski Fiats from the 1970s.

“Actually, it is no problem at all.  It is beyond easy to get here.”

“But, June 16?” he says, hitting his fist on the steering wheel.  “After June 16, tourism from the United States went like this.”  He whistles while his hand goes downward, like describing a Black Tuesday stock market.
